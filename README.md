## Project Name
Khan Academy - James Bond Animation Project
## About
This project, created on the Khan Academy platform, involves animating an animal character that transforms into something else—in this case, James Bond. It draws inspiration from the iconic video game animations in the Nintendo 64 classic GoldenEye, showcasing a creative blend of character animation and seamless transitions.
## Prerequisites
To run this project you need JavaScript installed on your system.
No additional libraries are required; it uses vanilla JavaScript for browser execution. Originally designed for the Khan Academy environment, it can be adapted for standard web browsers.
## Features
This project includes these features:

-Animation of an animal character with movement and actions

-Transformation effect turning the animal into James Bond

-Retro-style animation inspired by GoldenEye N64 gameplay

Simple, educational implementation focused on animation principles
## Getting Started & Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
`git clone https://github.com/NickAlvarez20/Khan-Academy-James-Bond-Animation.git`
## Usage
Include the JavaScript script (jamesBondAnimation.js) in an HTML file and open it in a web browser

Open the HTML file in a modern web browser to view the animation. For Khan Academy-specific context, refer to animal_attack-javascript.docx for notes on the original implementation.
## Learning Outcomes
This project helped me:

-Develop skills in character animation and transformation effects using JavaScript

-Apply retro game design principles to modern web-based projects

-Gain experience with the Khan Academy programming environment for interactive learning
